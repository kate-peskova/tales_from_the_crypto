BTC and ETH analysis using sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and named entity recognition


## Background

There's been a lot of hype in the news lately about cryptocurrency, so we want to take stock, so to speak, of the latest news headlines regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin.
In this assignment, we will apply natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will also apply fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.


This project uses the following techniques:

* Sentiment Analysis
* Natural Language Processing
* Named Entity Recognition

_Please note, due to implications with M1 chip, I had to run various installations immediately within the code._
